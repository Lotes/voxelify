# Untracked issues

## Do not!

* do not define boards, all concepts together work only with grids
* do not use `web-gl` for server-side rendering, it will not work (tryed at August 2016)
* do not use Typescript, Javascript is sufficient
* do not use generators (`yield` returns), they worsen the performance
